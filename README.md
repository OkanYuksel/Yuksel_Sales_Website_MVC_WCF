# Yuksel Sales Website MVC WCF

Technologies I Used in the Project
• The project was developed using the .NET MVC architecture.
• AngularJS, Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap were used on the frontend side.
• I developed a WCF Rest service for interfaces to communicate with the database. I developed WCF Rest service from both Ajax and controller using HttpWebRequest.
• I used MS SQL for my database.
